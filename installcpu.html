          This artifact is the reading 
          response for Brandt dealing with literacies and sponsors of that 
          specific domain. This shows that different people and events 
          throughout my life have given me perspectives in specific ways that 
          has shifted how I thought about that literacy and deterministically
          put me forth to see to end that destination. As through these 
          obstacles that mentor have placed in my path for me to grow in 
          both and personal sense. As I have learned skills by using my 
          literacy that are applicable to different avenues through managing
          others to accomplish as task to present my ideas in a presentation
          style while being asked about why my specific ideas should be 
          considered. This accurately connects with the theme of how 
          different experiences have shaped me and through those effects 
          have enabled for growth on various levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          This artifact made me think on how the different people 
          that have sponsored different aspects of my literacy what they 
          wanted in return as some sponsors wanted to be a mentor and 
          provide structure for next year after providing the sponsorship. As 
          well as through the how different goals have formed from those 
          sponsors as each have expectations on what I should have at the 
          end or learning such as gaining knowledge that should be further 
          shared with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          This has enabled me to look at different 
          connections between what my current functional literacy on a 
          subject and how I got there. This have provided ways on improving
          and detailing how exactly I can sponsor someone elseâ€™s literacy
          thereby increasing benefits in knowledge, As well having person 
          that can be relayed with literacy that was given. This piece changed
          the process of I thought about to evaluate different advice from 
          people and that each person has a whole collection of sponsors that 
          have given them advice

        <h2>Stage 1 LLN : Peer Review Draft</h2>

          This artifact is a first stage of the Language and Literacy Narrative. The experience was stressful as I was worried that my work was mediocre, and the way others were so passionate scared , giving me doubts if what I was writing was even acceptable as I languished with each press of a key. I was as some would say slow as molasses. This shows how I started as a writer in the beginning of the year while I had a small understanding of how the write in a effective and meaningful manner and this as the writer I am now fills me with pride as my writing has grown so much and now rather than fear I get excited when writing. I am working though the course outcomes understand the decisions making and production process as the choices I have made through my writing has evolve to a much stronger state.

        <p>
          The Skills I have learned are to constantly look at the productions of text when writing as a journey and adventure rather than a limit or constraint as the expressive nature of writing is limitless. I have through the various aspects of my life spread more positive messages and thoughts by using descriptive and meaningful writing which has made me and others more joyful.
