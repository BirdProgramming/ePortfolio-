            What is this artifact? What was your experience with creating it?
        What does it show, or how does it connect to the focal theme,
        narrative or goals of your portfolio? This artifact is the reading
        response for Brandt dealing with literacies and sponsors of that
        specific domain. This shows that different people and events
        throughout my life have given me perspectives in specific ways that
        has shifted how I thought about that literacy and deterministically
        put me forth to see to end that destination. As through these
        obstacles that mentor have placed in my path for me to grow in
        both and personal sense. As I have learned skills by using my
        literacy that are applicable to different avenues through managing
        others to accomplish as task to present my ideas in a presentation
        style while being asked about why my specific ideas should be
        considered. This accurately connects with the theme of how
        different experiences have shaped me and through those effects
        have enabled for growth on various levels.
        o What does this artifact demonstrate about how you’re working
        toward the course outcomes and what you have learned in this
        course? This artifact made me think on how the different people
        that have sponsored different aspects of my literacy what they
        wanted in return as some sponsors wanted to be a mentor and
        provide structure for next year after providing the sponsorship. As
        well as through the how different goals have formed from those
        sponsors as each have expectations on what I should have at the
        end or learning such as gaining knowledge that should be further
        shared with others.
        o How does this piece demonstrate a variety of capabilities, skillsets,
        and knowledge (e.g. writing and literacy skills, multimedia skills,
        research skills, and/or ability to make connections within and
        outside of the course)? This has enabled me to look at different
        connections between what my current functional literacy on a
        subject and how I got there. This have provided ways on improving
        and detailing how exactly I can sponsor someone else’s literacy
        thereby increasing benefits in knowledge, As well having person
        that can be relayed with literacy that was given. This piece changed
