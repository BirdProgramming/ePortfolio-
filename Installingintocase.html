    </p>
    <p>
        The artifact that I want to detail in this second case is the Language and Literacy Narrative which
        has shaped how I thought regarding the literacy of computers. I
        now have and understanding of how that came to be through the
        various experiences, communities, and mentors that have shaped
        me as a person through this literacy. The experience was one of
        curiosity because at first, I never considered that to be literacy until
        I dug into the experiences and realized that this as literacy has really
        defined me. This connects that through dedication, impactful
        events, and various different challenges that I faced throughout.
        This bridges that through the key experiences, discourse
        communities, and mentors. As I have grown with my knowledge of
        computer both in that literacy and as a person.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have learned through this assessment how to change my
      process for writing from the planning stage as well as the aspects of
      creating effective arguments. I have also learned how to better
      understand the process of production as I have learned to target a
      specific audience and explain new concepts and information
      through definitions, descriptions, examples, analogies, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      This piece represents through ley points
      how I related different articles regarding literacies and discourse
      communities. This was done by present various scenarios where
      these terms are applicable and have shaped my understanding and
      through process currently. As these topics of literacy and discourse
      communities enable a connection of point about how on has
      learned and been changed through their life. Additionally, I have
      applied the process of revision and detailed planning through which
      I can enable for more creative and thoughtful arguments to convey
      the central theme and message.

  <h2>Outcome Relections #2 </h2>
  <p align="center">
    <a href="assets/documents/OutcomeRelections2.docx">View Document</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    This artifact reflects the various course outcomes I have learned and realized their significance in both my current experience and past experiences. 
    I had an interesting time reflecting on the various retrospection I had when looking through the outcome reflection and how my understanding has expanded. 
    This shows how I have changed on what these outcomes mean to me and how incorporate different attributes I have towards these outcomes from contexts such as the communities and circles I am am integrated within 
    As such is the language and literacy that continues to affect my writing and perspectives through literacy and language.
  </p>
  <p>
    This artifact displays that I have learned about the various course outcomes in that I am better able from understanding them to apply them in both my writing and life as the different outcomes when understood changes the perspective you view the different ideas. I would say that I have learned about the revision process in that this assignment enabled me to see how I applied what I learned in the course on the assignments both and outside. An example, of how I revise my different discussion posts in philosophy where before leaning about the outcomes as I have now, I would be unfocused in presenting an argument that is without connection and structed. Whereas now I present salient and concise where the reader understands the from perspective and the prompts perspective to evaluate the claims, I have made in regards to the discussion prompt.
  </p>
  <p>
    The capacity for my perspectives towards different contexts, writing processes, and language and literacy was more broadly applied when retrospectively looking at this artifact. As through this I have developed skills that I will take in my future endeavors.
