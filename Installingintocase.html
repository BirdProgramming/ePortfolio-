    </p>
    <p>
        The artifact that I want to detail in this second case is the Language and Literacy Narrative which
        has shaped how I thought regarding the literacy of computers. I
        now have and understanding of how that came to be through the
        various experiences, communities, and mentors that have shaped
        me as a person through this literacy. The experience was one of
        curiosity because at first, I never considered that to be literacy until
        I dug into the experiences and realized that this as literacy has really
        defined me. This connects that through dedication, impactful
        events, and various different challenges that I faced throughout.
        This bridges that through the key experiences, discourse
        communities, and mentors. As I have grown with my knowledge of
        computer both in that literacy and as a person.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have learned through this assessment how to change my
      process for writing from the planning stage as well as the aspects of
      creating effective arguments. I have also learned how to better
      understand the process of production as I have learned to target a
      specific audience and explain new concepts and information
      through definitions, descriptions, examples, analogies, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      This piece represents through ley points
      how I related different articles regarding literacies and discourse
      communities. This was done by present various scenarios where
      these terms are applicable and have shaped my understanding and
      through process currently. As these topics of literacy and discourse
      communities enable a connection of point about how on has
      learned and been changed through their life. Additionally, I have
      applied the process of revision and detailed planning through which
      I can enable for more creative and thoughtful arguments to convey
      the central theme and message.

    <a href="assets/documents/Portrait of a Writer.docx">View Document</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The artifact is the Portrait of a Writer assignment which details how I have changed as writer in the duration of the course. The experience creating it was one of joy as I as able to utilize all the skills and lessons I have learned throughout this course to effectively create a retrospective piece that encapsulates the essence of my change as a writer. The connection between this is that the growth that have experience came in different bursts and changed perspective through working on various aspects of the assignments this help recap what I learned to be the great processes, techniques, and more that has truly grown my writing. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The outcomes that this artifacts display is goal setting in that I have constantly achieved goals by creating quality writing through using different metrics such as conveying arguments to better figurative language. The process of revisions that has been tested throughout this course as the I have learned to better utilize the strengths of writing processes and revisions.  </p>
  <p>
    The skills I have learned through this assignment are manyfold from think with reflection on how to improve and dynamically become aware of weakness in writing for revision. As well as how to allocate resources such as time and planning in the broad context of life and through this I will become more productive in my life.  </p>
