      This artifact is a reading response is Berkenkotter and Murray Reading Response which is dealing with revisions and the different stages of planning. The experience I had when creating was a curiosity as I realized that my current writing process was lacking in truly real revision as the arguments and the structure rather than being changed to suit the message were stranded and lost. This connects to central theme of growth as I knew that what I had been doing was not unlocking the potential I had to elegant pieces of writing instead I was confining myself into this narrow framework of though which relates to the outcomes wanting a writer to explore many opportunities and picking the ones that provide a diverse set of perspectives and cultures. As the works that have truly inspired people for change has been works that sets itself for consent revision and truly giving the reader an experience to understand that the issue is in relation to power and how through language and solidarity that can be changed.

      The skills and that I have learned has allowed me to make connections within the context of programming as through revisions I need to plan how I want other to understand and what I am doing in the various lines of code that I write. Through this course I have learned to connect with how revision is a powerful tool to through which others perspective can be representing in manner that respects and shows diversity of experiences.
