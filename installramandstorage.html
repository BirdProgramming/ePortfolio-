    <p>Artifact 2</p>
    <br>
    <p>What is this artifact? What was your experience with creating it?
        What does it show, or how does it connect to the focal theme,
        narrative or goals of your portfolio? The artifact that I want to detail
        in this second case is the Language and Literacy Narrative which
        has shaped how I thought regarding the literacy of computers. I
        now have and understanding of how that came to be through the
        various experiences, communities, and mentors that have shaped
        me as a person through this literacy. The experience was one of
        curiosity because at first, I never considered that to be literacy until
        I dug into the experiences and realized that this as literacy has really
        defined me. This connects that through dedication, impactful
        events, and various different challenges that I faced throughout.
        This bridges that through the key experiences, discourse
        communities, and mentors. As I have grown with my knowledge of
        computer both in that literacy and as a person.
        o What does this artifact demonstrate about how youâ€™re working
        toward the course outcomes and what you have learned in this
        course? I have learned through this assessment how to change my
        process for writing from the planning stage as well as the aspects of
        creating effective arguments. I have also learned how to better
        understand the process of production as I have learned to target a
        specific audience and explain new concepts and information
        through definitions, descriptions, examples, analogies, and more.
        o How does this piece demonstrate a variety of capabilities, skillsets,
        and knowledge (e.g. writing and literacy skills, multimedia skills,
        research skills, and/or ability to make connections within and
        outside of the course)? This piece represents through ley points
        how I related different articles regarding literacies and discourse
        communities. This was done by present various scenarios where
        these terms are applicable and have shaped my understanding and
        through process currently. As these topics of literacy and discourse
        communities enable a connection of point about how on has
        learned and been changed through their life. Additionally, I have
        applied the process of revision and detailed planning through which
        I can enable for more creative and thoughtful arguments to convey
        the central theme and message.</p>
