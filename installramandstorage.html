    <h2>Melzer Reading Response Artifact 3</h2>

    <p>
      This artifact is the reading response for Melzer which is related to discourse communities and what they are and how these groups function. The experience I had creating it was enlightening as I learned how these groups which are complex in that the purposes are supposed to serve a certain niche of people that have a common interest and seeks to achieve a single goal. This made me ponder different experiences of discourse groups and communities in my life as I was writing and allow for realization of their effects on me in various aspects from communication to goal setting. This hits home the theme of growth and procession in that that how these groups have affected my thinking and perspectives in both writing and thought. As I have no used different elements from past groups in my writing both directly and indirectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Melzerâ€™s work has directly inspired how I write in that I incorporate the teachings of the various discourse communities I was in from cyber security to robotics and  allowing these elements within my framework of writing has expanded the expression of myself and the characteristics that have made me how I am. As I gained confidence of being unique and rather than a bland cookie cutter example of my old writing

    <h2>Outcome Relections #2 Artifact 4</h2>
    <p align="center">
      <a href="assets/documents/OutcomeRelections2.docx">View Document</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This artifact reflects the various course outcomes I have learned and realized their significance in both my current experience and past experiences. 
      I had an interesting time reflecting on the various retrospection I had when looking through the outcome reflection and how my understanding has expanded. 
      This shows how I have changed on what these outcomes mean to me and how incorporate different attributes I have towards these outcomes from contexts such as the communities and circles I am am integrated within 
      As such is the language and literacy that continues to affect my writing and perspectives through literacy and language.
    </p>
    <p>
      This artifact displays that I have learned about the various course outcomes in that I am better able from understanding them to apply them in both my writing and life as the different outcomes when understood changes the perspective you view the different ideas. I would say that I have learned about the revision process in that this assignment enabled me to see how I applied what I learned in the course on the assignments both and outside. An example, of how I revise my different discussion posts in philosophy where before leaning about the outcomes as I have now, I would be unfocused in presenting an argument that is without connection and structed. Whereas now I present salient and concise where the reader understands the from perspective and the prompts perspective to evaluate the claims, I have made in regards to the discussion prompt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The capacity for my perspectives towards different contexts, writing processes, and language and literacy was more broadly applied when retrospectively looking at this artifact. As through this I have developed skills that I will take in my future endeavors.
