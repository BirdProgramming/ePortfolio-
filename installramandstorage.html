      This artifact is the reading response for Melzer which is related to discourse communities and what they are and how these groups function. The experience I had creating it was enlightening as I learned how these groups which are complex in that the purposes are supposed to serve a certain niche of people that have a common interest and seeks to achieve a single goal. This made me ponder different experiences of discourse groups and communities in my life as I was writing and allow for realization of their effects on me in various aspects from communication to goal setting. This hits home the theme of growth and procession in that that how these groups have affected my thinking and perspectives in both writing and thought. As I have no used different elements from past groups in my writing both directly and indirectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Melzerâ€™s work has directly inspired how I write in that I incorporate the teachings of the various discourse communities I was in from cyber security to robotics and  allowing these elements within my framework of writing has expanded the expression of myself and the characteristics that have made me how I am. As I gained confidence of being unique and rather than a bland cookie cutter example of my old writing
