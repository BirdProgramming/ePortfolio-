      This artifact is the reading 
      response for Brandt dealing with literacies and sponsors of that 
      specific domain. This shows that different people and events 
      throughout my life have given me perspectives in specific ways that 
      has shifted how I thought about that literacy and deterministically
      put me forth to see to end that destination. As through these 
      obstacles that mentor have placed in my path for me to grow in 
      both and personal sense. As I have learned skills by using my 
      literacy that are applicable to different avenues through managing
      others to accomplish as task to present my ideas in a presentation
      style while being asked about why my specific ideas should be 
      considered. This accurately connects with the theme of how 
      different experiences have shaped me and through those effects 
      have enabled for growth on various levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      This artifact made me think on how the different people 
      that have sponsored different aspects of my literacy what they 
      wanted in return as some sponsors wanted to be a mentor and 
      provide structure for next year after providing the sponsorship. As 
      well as through the how different goals have formed from those 
      sponsors as each have expectations on what I should have at the 
      end or learning such as gaining knowledge that should be further 
      shared with others.
    </p>
    <p>
      This has enabled me to look at different 
      connections between what my current functional literacy on a 
      subject and how I got there. This have provided ways on improving
      and detailing how exactly I can sponsor someone elseâ€™s literacy
      thereby increasing benefits in knowledge, As well having person 
      that can be relayed with literacy that was given. This piece changed
      the process of I thought about to evaluate different advice from 
      people and that each person has a whole collection of sponsors that 
      have given them advice
